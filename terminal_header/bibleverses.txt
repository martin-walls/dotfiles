Be still, and know that I am God.\n~ Psalm 46:10 ~
For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope - the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.\n~ Titus 2:11-14 ~
We take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.\n~ 2 Corinthians 10:5 ~
The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light.\n~ Romans 13:12 ~
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey - whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.\n~ Romans 6:15-18 ~
I am ASSOCIATED WITH CHRIST and I am FREE IN HIM
Have NO FEAR of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, for THE LORD WILL BE AT YOUR SIDE and will KEEP YOUR FOOT FROM BEING SNARED.\n~ Proverbs 3:25-26 ~
Above all else, GUARD YOUR HEART, for EVERYTHING YOU DO FLOWS FROM IT.\n~ Proverbs 4:23 ~
I have CLEANSED MY HEART, I AM PURE AND FREE FROM SIN because I AM IN CHRIST\n(Proverbs 20:9)
DO NOT BE WISE IN YOUR OWN EYES; fear the Lord and shun evil.\n~ Proverbs 3:7 ~
Evil people are trapped by sin, but THE RIGHTEOUS ESCAPE, SHOUTING FOR JOY.\n~ Proverbs 29:6 ~
Through LOVE and FAITHFULNESS, SIN IS ATONED FOR.\nGod is LOVE, God is FAITHFUL => GOD WILL RESTORE\n~ Proverbs 16:6a ~
Whover conceals their sin does not prosper, but the one who CONFESSES AND RENOUNCES THEM FINDS MERCY.\n~ Proverbs 28:13 ~
I am a SAINT, I am PURE and FREE, I am a CHILD OF GOD
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It doe not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.
I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\n~ Psalm 119:11 ~
I don't know what to do, but my eyes are on you, Lord.\n~ 2 Chronicles 20:12 ~
Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the battle is not yours, but God's.\n~ 2 Chronicles 20:15 ~
