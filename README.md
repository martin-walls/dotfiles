# Dotfiles

My random collection of config files. Very much constantly a work in progress.

Install script based from [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/script/bootstrap).

Run `install.sh` to install dotfiles.
- `*.symlink` files are symlinked into `$HOME` without the extension.
- Subdirectories of `.config/` are symlinked into `$HOME/.config`
