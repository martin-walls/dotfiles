# Mailspring config files

`keymap.json` location:

- Linux (snap): `~/snap/mailspring/common/keymap.json`

~~`config.json` location:~~

* ~~Linux (snap): `~/snap/mailspring/common/config.json`~~

`config.json` is recreated by Mailspring every time settings are changed, overwriting the symlink, so this has been removed. Maybe a better solution anyway as it allows for different themes etc. on different devices.
